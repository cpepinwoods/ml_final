Hello!

Most, if not all, of this code runs linearly through the notebooks. There is one major exception, the dataset (found here: https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/bulk-csv.html) is too large to be uploaded to GitHub, and thus, neither preprocessing file will run without the user first downloading the dataset into the project folder and renaming it 'openpowerlifting.csv'
